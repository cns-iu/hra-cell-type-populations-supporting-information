# Suppoprting Information for "Constructing and Using Cell Type Populations of the Human Reference Atlas"
 
The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) aims to represent major anatomical structures and their healthy cell type populations across scales to improve cell type annotation, tissue registration, and clinical use cases. This paper presents scalable workflows to compute and use cell type populations for the HRA from high-quality single-cell (sc) transcriptomics and spatial, sc-proteomics datasets. For construction, 9,613 datasets with 66,555,503 cells were downloaded from four data portals; parsed and enriched with harmonized donor, 3D registration, and provenance metadata; annotated using Azimuth, Cell Typist, and popV; and published as Linked Open Data. HRApop version 0.10.3 covers cell type populations for 40 unique anatomical structures across 13 organs derived from 553 datasets with 18,180,772 cells for 193 3D extraction sites. Resulting data was validated in terms of quality and coverage; spatial location and cell type annotation prediction accuracy; hetero-/homogeneity of anatomical structures and organs; and clustering of datasets based on cell type population. HRApop usage includes predicting cell type annotation for 281 3D extraction sites and the spatial origin for 3,992 datasets, incl. Tabula Sapiens data. To show generalizability, the very same workflow was run for spatial, sc-proteomics datasets.
